# Feature Tasks
  - Write a function called business trip
  - Arguments: graph, array of city names
  - Return: cost or null
  <br>

Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
<br>

# Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
<br>
Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
<br>
Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
